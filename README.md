# RESTFulAPITestFramework
POJO(DTO/model) based design pattern. 
I create POJO class for each post/delete/put request and response payload. 
Use of serialization, deserialization.
Latest ExtentReports and TestNG
JSON schema validations
Log4J integration 
Use of Lombok to get rid of writing Getters and Setters in POJOs
